Long time Kodi user, but I have always used it as a simple media player where I browse files in folders and have never liked generating a library (although it has been many years since last i tried!) On a new device I've been setting up I accidentally set it scraping and creating a library.

When there are multiple files of the same movie, you can choose which version you want to stream but it only shows you the resolution and bitrate.

So from my understanding, the VC's main View in the Storyboard is considered the V in the MVC. So basically all my IBOutlets go into the View file. I have some questions: 1. Is it necessary to have a View file for each UI element or is one View file just enough? I know that custom Views would need their own View file of coarse. 2.
