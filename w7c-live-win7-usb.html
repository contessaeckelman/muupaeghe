Short story, upgraded to am4 mobo and i just learned that usb is not supported in win7 so my mouse/kb is dead outside of bios. Im not against installing w10, so if i create a w10 usb boot drive from my laptop, will that work? Will the usb ports work when i get to the install part? Or do i seriously need to buy a dvd drive/burner and dvds for my laptop to get around this bullshit?

Hi everyone, I'm trying to set up a dual boot system with Win7 and (preferably) Linux Mint. I already installed Win7 on its partition and have set up the Linux partition. However, when I try to run Mint from the live USB and install it, I end up in a black screen. I googled a little bit and found out that this is due to the GTX 1060 that I use and the lack of proper drivers. I found some - in my view quite tedious - work arounds for this problem that are dated ca. 10 months –ò–∑ –¥—Ä–∞–π–≤–µ—Ä–æ–≤ –¥–ª—è w8 –Ω–∞ 7-–∫—É –Ω–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞–≤–ª–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –¥—Ä–∞–π–≤–µ—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞ usb 3. –í–æ–æ–±—â–µ–º, —Ç–∞–Ω—Ü—ã —Å –±—É–±–Ω–∞–º–∏ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.

I want to put Windows 7, 8 ISOs and a few linux ISOs on there. What do you use? I did some googling and found a few options, but some like kinda sketchy. –õ—é–±—É—é —Ñ–ª–µ—à–∫—É –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –±–µ–∑ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º –ø—Ä–µ–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Å —Ç–æ—á–∫–∏ –∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è Windows –≤ –Ω–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∂–µ—Å—Ç–∫–∏–π –¥–∏—Å–∫. 
This will be my first time using any Linux programs and I wanted to start with it from day one with a new laptop. I have one program that is not Linux compatable that I will have to keep available so I canno't remove windows completely but would like to have Ubuntu as my primary. Any help for this noob would be very helpful. Edit 1 : I am currently downloading Wubi to a USB, if this is wrong, please tell me because it is a one hour download.

Recently, I have discovered that Windows is like 80% trash and shit. You see, I had Windows 10 Pro 32 bit (updated from win7 when it was free), and I wanted 64 bit. Had the C: partition ~100 GB and almost full. So, I downloaded the installation media creation utility. It was downloading the image. Done. Said that i needed at least a ~6 GB USB stick. Ok, plugged in a 7.5 GB one. Selected it, AND NOW IT SAID IT WASN'T ENOUGH. Ok, now I was angry.

I am a computer-illerate user who has been using Windows forever, and am now trying out Linux Mint - Cinnamon 19.1 from a bootable USB drive before attempting to load it on a partitioned HDD. (There are many terms that I see on this discussion group that I simply do not know what they mean.) My version of Linux Mint freezes totally (no response from Ctrl+Alt+anything or Ctrl+F-anything) when I try loading drivers for my printer scanner.

After that i tried to restart my PC and tried to install it but all it shows is the blinking cursor and never enters the setup menu. Is there a fix for this?

TL;DR (even if it's not that short üòÜ) I recently moved from Win7 to Linux Mint 19.1 tessa, DE XFCE. My questions are: 1. How can i increase the mouse speed? Already set to the max Aceleration and Sensibility but nothing changed. 2. There is a way to makes the OS even faster? Like in Win7 there was the possibility to remove some special effects, disable services amp useless bloatware SW, remove Aero etc.etc. 3.

Hello, I'm trying to install manjaro on an older machine, specifically a 2011 HP probook 6460b, and I'm running into issues. I've got the x86_64 live install booting from an SD card, and can run the installer to completion just fine. However after rebooting, the computer can't find an OS on the HDD. I find this odd, as it recognizes the live media just fine. Some info on the machine: it was running win7, but was so full of malware I decided to nuke it from orbit and not bother recovering.

When I tried to install it from another DVD it didn't load into the live environment, displayed some error messages and went straight into Grub rescue. The same happened but with the USB itself when I used the Linux pendrive install tool thingie I found. Didn't give me the live environment when I just tried to make a simple live USB with Rufus out of it. What could be the problem? I'm using a laptop with:.

Here is what went on wanted to install win7 threw usb stick.all good. came to part where I can manage partitions, confirmed to delete primary partition (had linux distros on two other logical partitions).ok takes time to complete deletion.BUT took quite unusual long time so I tought it got frozen and should restart. ofc now looking back it was bad idea.after immediate restart pc couldnt go much further than first welcome screen think vintage press button. I have several machines running WinXP and Win7 in Parallels Desktop on MacOS. Now I‚Äôm thinking of adding a few Linux machines to the mix (carry one laptop, use whatever OS suits the task at hand.) Does anyone have experience with Parallels? If I can get the live USBs to mount on the Mac, is that my installation path? Any other suggestions for a MacOS, WinDoze, Linux multi-OS environment on a 12‚Äù MacBook (the skinny one with only a USB3 and audio port.).

Hello all, i'm suffering and on the verge of despair. There are two main Problems, where one emerges from another. So there was a time i tried to OC my CPU, where i also tried to change the RAM-profile through MSI's "Memory-Try It". For a short while everything was fine, but my temperature made me feel uncomfortable, so i reset all settings in BIOS and everything worked just fine. CPU: Intel - Core i5-7600K 3.8 GHz Quad-CoreCPU Cooler: be quiet! - Pure Rock Slim Motherboard: MSI - Z270 GAMING. I don't know where else to post it so here it goes. I want to use Android and Win7 simultaneously for some time (Just experimenting, Live booting isn't an option currently). I downloaded Android-x86 ( bit) iso and LiLi ( as suggested. LiLi needs the Bootable USB formatted in FAT32 ( So, should the HDD partition that I'm going to install Android on, also needs to be FAT32. 
Hello everyone. I have a live set up including launchpad mk2, launchcontol xl, arturia minilab mk2 and fl12. My launchpad is the last member of the squad and it was working normally when i get it 2 months ago. After using it for a few days, it started to freeze during session and i had to unplug-plug it to keep working. Now the problem got bigger, it freezez seconds after i start live performance. Especially if i push session button it just freezes in its last color scheme. Funny thing it works. Hi everyone! I got an old workstation (HP xw8600) for free and wanted to put it to good use mainly web browsing, office, light/minor image editing, etc (stuff that doesnt require that much from the system) HDD- WD 500GB (that has 8 bad sectors according to ubuntu disk utility) Intel Xeon X5450 @3.00Ghz 10GB or RAM (4x 2GB sticks and 2x 1GB). The main problem/issue is that for some reason I cant install windows (yet im able to install ubuntu 18 without any issue): Im trying. Joystick is installed, functions and can be configured in OS. Joystick is detected by game program and can be configured both in the main menu options and the gameplay window options. Save on those both work. Joystick does NOTHING in actual gameplay environment. In both Win7 and Win10 on both rendering systems. This is the steam version, hopefully the PC install version gives me less trouble. Still randomly from install to install having the items in the shop rotate opposite direction. TLDR: I need a distro that is Windows friendly, that will easily play movie files (probably VLC) and let me set the audio and video to go to the monitor and let me set desktop resolution to 1080p (compatible with the AMD graphics chip listed below). So the gist is, my niece has a little boy with Downs Syndrome. He loves Chuggington and Thomas the Train. I downloaded a bunch of movies and tv shows for him to watch and gave them an old laptop. gtHP Pavilion dv4 gtAMD Turion 
New Ssd grub problem Hi, I've had a pc with win7 as OS, yesterday I've installed a new ssd drive (without initialize with win) , I made a live USB with Debian and then I've installed in it. When I started the bios, the ssd wasn't in the boot order, but I've installed Debian in the ssd anyway. After the installation I put the grub in the ssd (entirely Debian). When I reboot the system, it booted windows with mbr, so I tried to uninstall Debian with windows by formatting –£–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –º—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–∑–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–æ—á–Ω–∞—è USB —Ñ–ª–µ—à–∫–∞ - MultiBoot USB Flash v.2.0 by OVGorskiy 04.2016  –î–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –¥–ª—è. –ù–∞–±–æ—Ä –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è–µ—Ç –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª—è—Ç—å —Ä–∞–±–æ—á—É—é —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—É, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ–≥—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –¥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∏–±—É—Ç–∏–≤.
