I truely love this game it is the only one of it's kind that I know of and the level of realism is amazing. However honestly this patch has left me extremely burned out. Quests: The initial ridiculous requirements some quests had plus the find in raid mechanics. I have friends with hundreds of raids and only 2 of the 6 find in raid fuel conditioners.
